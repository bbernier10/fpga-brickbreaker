# FPGA Brickbreaker

Final project for ECE 6213, Design of VLSI Circuits

Coded by [Brandon Bernier](mailto:bbernier@gwu.edu) 

A custom version of the classic Brickbreaker game written entirely in the hardware description language Verilog and implemented on the Altera DE2 board. Game is complete with various options such as a half paddle, super ball, pause, etc. 

## Usage

Compile the code using Altera software suite and write it to the Altera FPGA. The outermost buttons on the board are used to move the paddle left and right to bounce the ball back up into the playing field. The switches on the board enable the various additions such as half paddle mode, super ball, pause, etc.
